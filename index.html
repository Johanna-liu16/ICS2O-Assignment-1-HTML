          <p>Linus Trovalds is a Finnish computer scientist behind the operating system Linux. At the age of ten, Trovalds took interest in computer programming and later became a computer science student at the University of Helsinki. By then, he bought his first PC computer, however he was rather displeased with it. Trovalds's PC a disk operating system from Microsoft (MS-DOS), but he prefered the UNIX operating system that were used in the university computers. In addition, Trovalds decieded to create his own verson of UNIX which soon became the operating system known today, Linus. In 1991, Trovalds released the software and source code online. After the refinement and help of many programmers, by 1994, Linux kernel version 1.0 was released.</p>

          <p>Linux was not as easy to use as the more popular operating systems, such as Window's, Apple's Mac OS, amd IBM OS/2. However, it became a remarble, reliable, and efficient system that rarely crashed. Since Linux was free, many companies announced plans to support Linux as an inexpensive alternative for Windows. In addition, unlike proprietary OS, Linux's source code can be viewed and modified by anyone. Many organizations and governerments have expressed security reservations using software with concealed code.</p>

          <p>Linux accounts for the most servers on the internet because it is an open-source and is modifiable for different uses. Linus is popular among a variety of systems, such as cellular telephones and supercomputers. In additiion, Android (Google's operating system for mobile devices) and Chrome OS (Google's operating system) are both Linux-based. The augmentation of user-friendly desktop  environments, web browsers, and games helped increase Linux's popularity; making it suitable for home and office desktops.</p>
