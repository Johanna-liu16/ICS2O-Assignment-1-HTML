  <center>Linus Trovalds is a Finnish computer scientist behind the operating system Linux. At the age of ten, Trovalds took interest in computer programming and later became a computer science student at the University of Helsinki. By then, he bought his first PC computer, however he was rather displeased with it. Trovalds's PC a disk operating system from Microsoft (MS-DOS), but he prefered the UNIX operating system that were used in the university computers. In addition, Trovalds decieded to create his own verson of UNIX which soon became the operating system known today, Linus. In 1991, Trovalds released the software and source code online. After the refinement and help of many programmers, by 1994, Linux kernel version 1.0 was released. </center>
